## Objective üéØ
With the aim of allowing a high degree of customization for the user, the page features 5 menus:
`Get Data`, `Modify Indicator Parameters`, `Modify Strategy Parameters`, `Modify Trend Parameters`, `Modify Result Parameters`, each menu with a specific responsibility.

## Data üìä

The `Get Data` menu's objective is to allow the user to choose the type of market from which they want to retrieve data:

- `Spot, Futures, Mark Price`: The user should select the Timeframe and Symbol for the data they wish to obtain.

- `Custom`: If the user already has the data, they can select the `Custom` option, which supports files in `parquet` and `csv` formats.

## Strategy ‚ôüÔ∏è

The `Modify Strategy Parameters` menu enables the user to adjust signal parameters as well as entry and exit settings for the setup. (Possibly, tick size will be removed in a future update.)

- `Lowest Low`: Specifies where the stop loss will be placed, defaulting to the current candle's low.
- `Tick Size`: Determines the value added to the entry price or subtracted from the stop loss.
- `Payoff`: Sets the target location, defaulting to `2` times the signal candle.
- `Wick Percentage`: Sets the minimum acceptable percentage for the signal candle's wick.

## Trend Definition üìà

The `Modify Trend Parameters` menu allows the user to select how indicators define the trend, which indicators are used, and which price type (Open, High, Low, Close) is used to identify the upward trend.

## Result ü™ô

The `Modify Result Parameters` menu aims to modify risk management parameters. The submenu `Modify Result Settings` is used to configure how results are displayed and whether the user wants to simulate returns in USD or the trading currency.
